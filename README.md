#### BBC iPlayer A-Z

This is webpage built for this [BBC Challenge](https://www.gapjumpers.me/questions/bbc-digital/qs-286/?just_committed=True).


#### Challenge Brief


Our team has been asked to work with a new HTTP API that provides iPlayer with lists of programmes sorted alphabetically.


Your task is to use the API to generate an A-Z listing for the website. A simple web page that will list out all the content to be viewed on different devices.

Each of the listing pages should include:

- a list of programme titles and images
- the ability to paginate if the letter has more than 20 results
- navigation to other letters

You may implement your solution in PHP/ node.js or any appropriate (i.e. non-obscure) language. But please make sure your solution is working end-to-end and you include instructions for us to run and test your code. Please host your application on Heroku or similar and include a link.

We would like to see TDD being applied in this exercise.
